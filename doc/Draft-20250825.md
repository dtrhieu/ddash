## üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Architecture (2025-08-25)

A modern, scalable architecture with separate frontend and backend services:

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) with PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers with Nginx reverse proxy
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Caching**: Redis for session management
- **Background Tasks**: Celery for asynchronous processing

### Architecture Layers

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - React frontend application
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile
   - Component-based UI architecture

2. **API Layer**
   - FastAPI RESTful services
   - Authentication and authorization middleware
   - Request/response validation

3. **Business Logic Layer**
   - Python services implementing business rules
   - Data processing and validation
   - Integration with external systems

4. **Data Access Layer**
   - Prisma ORM for database operations
   - PostgreSQL for data persistence
   - Redis for caching
